  <h2>Marine Otter </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> The marine otter (Lontra felina) is a rare and poorly known South American mammal of the <a href="Weasel.html">weasel family</a> (Mustelidae). The scientific name means "otter cat", and in Spanish, the marine otter is also often referred to as gato marino: "marine cat". The marine otter spends much of its time out of the water and rarely ventures into freshwater or estuarine habitats, unlike the almost fully aquatic <a href="SeaOtter.html">sea otter</a> (Enhydra lutris) of the northeast <a href="Pacific.html">Pacific</a> and most other otter species. </p>
