  <h2>Eared Seal</h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> An eared seal or otariid or otary is any member of the <a href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammal</a> family Otariidae, one of three groupings of <a href="Pinniped.html">pinnipeds.</a> They comprise 15 extant species in seven genera (another species became extinct in the 1950s) and are commonly known either as <a href="SeaLion.html">sea lions</a> or fur seals, distinct from true <a href="Seal.html">seals (phocids)</a> and the <a href="Walrus.html">walrus (odobenids)</a>. Otariids are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, feeding and migrating in the water, but breeding and resting on land or ice. They reside in subpolar, temperate, and equatorial waters throughout the <a href="Pacific.html">Pacific</a> and Southern Oceans and the southern Indian and <a href="Atlantic.html">Atlantic Oceans</a>. They are conspicuously absent in the north Atlantic. </p>
