  <h2>Fissiped </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Fissipedia is a former biological suborder comprising the largely land-based families of the order Carnivora. By and large, members of this suborder are meat-eaters, with the <a href="GiantPanda.html">giant panda</a> and <a href="RedPanda.html">red panda</a> (each exclusively herbivorous) being the most notable exceptions. </p>
  <p> In some former taxonomic classifications, <a href="Pinniped.html">Pinnipedia</a> is treated as an order in its own right rather than as a suborder within the Carnivora. In these classifications, Fissipedia is the sole suborder of Carnivora, and is thus omitted on the grounds of redundancy. </p>
