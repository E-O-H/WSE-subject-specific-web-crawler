  <h2>Sirenian </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Sirenia (commonly referred to as sea cows) are an order of fully aquatic, herbivorous <a href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammals</a> that inhabit swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine wetlands, and coastal marine waters. Four species are living, in two families and genera. These are the <a href="Dugong.html">dugong</a> (one species) and <a href="Manatee.html">manatees</a> (three species). Sirenia also includes Steller's sea cow, extinct since the 18th century, and a number of taxa known only from fossils. The order evolved during the Eocene, more than 50 million years ago. </p>
  <p> Sirenia, commonly sirenians, are also referred to by the common name sirens, deriving from the sirens of Greek mythology. This comes from a legend about their discovery, involving lonely sailors mistaking them for mermaids. </p>
  <p> "Sea cow" (seekoei) is also the name for a <a href="Hippopotamus.html">hippopotamus</a> in Afrikaans. In some Germanic languages, the word Sea can mean either a body of fresh or salt water, so this follows from the species inhabiting lakes in southern Africa rather than the sea itself. </p>
