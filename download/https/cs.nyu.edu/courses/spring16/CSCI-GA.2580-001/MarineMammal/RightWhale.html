  <h2>Right Whale </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Right whales are three species of large baleen <a href="Whale.html">whales</a> of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and the southern right whale (E. australis). They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale. Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin. The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice. Right whales can grow up to more than 18 m (59 ft) long with the maximum record of 19.8 m (65 ft)[8] and weigh up to 100 short tons (91 t; 89 long tons), significantly larger than other coastal species such as <a href="HumpbackWhale.html">humpbacks, </a> <a href="GrayWhale.html">grays,</a> or <a href="BrydesWhale.html">bryde's,</a> but smaller than <a href="BlueWhale.html">blues.</a> Right whales were named by whalers who identified them as the "right" whale to kill on a hunt due to the plentiful oil and baleen they could provide.[9] </p>
