  <h2>Pinniped </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Pinnipeds (/?p?n??p?dz/), (from Latin pinna "fin" and pes, pedis "foot") commonly known as <a href="Seal.html">seals,</a> are a widely distributed and diverse clade of carnivorous, fin-footed, semiaquatic <a href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammals.</a> They comprise the extant families Odobenidae (whose only living member is the <a href="Walrus.html">walrus</a>), Otariidae (the eared seals: <a href="SeaLion.html">sea lions</a> and <a href="FurSeal.html">fur seals</a>), and Phocidae (the earless seals, or true seals). There are 33 extant species of pinnipeds, and more than 50 extinct species have been described from fossils. While seals were historically thought to have descended from two ancestral lines, molecular evidence supports them as a monophyletic lineage (descended from one ancestral line). Pinnipeds belong to the order Carnivora and their closest living relatives are <a href="Bear.html">bears</a> and musteloids ( <a href="Weasel.html">weasels,</a> <a href="Raccoon.html">raccoons,</a> <a href="Skunk.html">skunks</a> and <a href="RedPanda.html">red pandas</a>), having diverged about 50 million years ago. </p>
