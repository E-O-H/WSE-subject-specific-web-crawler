  <h2>Bear </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Bears are mammals of the family Ursidae. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the <a href="Pinniped.html">pinnipeds</a> being their closest living relatives. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. </p>
  <p> Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails. While the <a href="PolarBear.html">polar bear</a> is mostly carnivorous, and the <a href="GiantPanda.html">giant panda</a> feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. </p>
