  <h2> Manatee </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Manatees (family Trichechidae, genus Trichechus) are large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous <a href="MarineMammal.html"> marine mammals</a> sometimes known as sea cows. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing three of the four living species in the order <a href="Sirenian.html">Sirenia:</a> the Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), the West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), and the West African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis). They measure up to 4.0 metres (13.1 ft) long, weigh as much as 590 kilograms (1,300 lb), and have paddle-like flippers. The name manat¨ª comes from the Ta¨ªno, a pre-Columbian people of the Caribbean, meaning "breast". </p>
