  <h2> Dolphin </h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic <a href="MarineMammal.html">marine mammals.</a> They are an informal grouping within the order <a href="Cetacean.html">Cetacea,</a> excluding <a href="Whale.html">whales </a> and <a href="Porpoise.html">porpoises, </a> so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed <a href="Ungulate.html">ungulates,</a> and their closest living relatives are the <a href="Hippopotamus.html">hippopotamuses, </a> having diverged about 40 million years ago. </p>
