  <h2>Giant Panda</h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, lit. "black and white cat-foot"; simplified Chinese: ¥Û–‹√®; traditional Chinese: ¥Û–‹ÿà; pinyin: d®§ xi®Æng m®°o, lit. "big bear cat"), also known as panda bear or simply panda, is a <a href="Bear.html">bear</a> native to south central China. It is easily recognized by the large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the unrelated <a href="RedPanda.html">red panda.</a> Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food. </p>
