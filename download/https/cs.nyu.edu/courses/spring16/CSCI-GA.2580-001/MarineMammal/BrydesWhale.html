  <h2>Bryde's Whale</h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Bryde's <a href="Whale.html">whale</a> or Bryde's whale complex (/bru?d?/BREW-d?) putatively comprises two species of <a href="Rorqual.html">rorqual</a> and maybe three. The "complex" means the number and classification remains unclear because of a lack of definitive information and research. The common Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera brydei, Olsen, 1913), a larger form that occurs worldwide in warm temperate and tropical waters, and the sittang or Eden's whale (B. edeni, Anderson, 1879) a smaller form that may be restricted to the Indo-Pacific.[2] There is also a smaller, coastal form of B. brydei off southern Africa, and perhaps another form in the Indo-Pacific that differs in skull morphology, tentatively referred to as the Indo-Pacific Bryde's whale. The recently described Omura's whale (B. omurai, Wada et al. 2003), was formerly considered a "pygmy" form of Bryde's, but is now recognized as a distinct species </p>
