  <h2>Beaked Whale</h2> (from Wikipedia) 
  <p> Beaked whales are the members of the family Ziphiidae, which consists of 22 species. These toothed <a href="Whale.html">whales</a> are notable for their elongated beaks. Among air-breathing animals, beaked whales are some of the most extreme divers: Cuvier's beaked whales regularly dive for an hour at a depth over 1,000 m (3,300 ft),[1] and the longest and deepest foraging dive recorded is 137.5 minutes and 2,992 m (9,816 ft). This is the greatest dive-depth known for a mammal. </p>
